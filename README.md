**Airplane Wildlife Collisions**

**Overview:**

Develope an interactive treemap visualization to analyze and present the financial and operational impact of wildlife collisions on U.S. airports over a 14-year period. The project synthesizes extensive data to reveal insights into the frequency of strikes and the economic consequences for the aviation industry.

**Features:**

1. Treemap Visualization: Utilizes size and color coding to represent the total cost of collisions at each airport, allowing for quick visual assessment of the most significant incidents.
2. Cost Analysis: Highlights outliers, such as the incident at LaGuardia Airport, which accounted for 97% of the airport's total collision costs.
3. Frequency Metrics: Includes a sortable list detailing the number of strikes per airport, providing a clear view of the prevalence of wildlife strikes across airports.
4. Passenger Traffic Correlation: Compares collision data with the 2014 airport passenger count to explore the relationship between airport traffic and collision incidents.

**Outcomes:**
The visualization effectively communicates the disproportionate nature of collision costs, with a small percentage of incidents accounting for the majority of damages. It serves as an informative tool for stakeholders to prioritize safety measures and mitigate risks associated with wildlife strikes.
